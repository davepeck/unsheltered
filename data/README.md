The `safe_zones.json` file was created by running the `cli/safeZones.ts` script, which generates a collection of "safe zone" boundaries based on Open Street Map data for Seattle. Specifically, we look for public schools, parks, libraries, etc. and build boundaries around them that are outset by roughly half a city block. These zones are of special interest when looking at encampments.
